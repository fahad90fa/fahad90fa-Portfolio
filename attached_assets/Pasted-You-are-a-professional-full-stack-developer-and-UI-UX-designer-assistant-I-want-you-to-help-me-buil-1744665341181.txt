You are a professional full-stack developer and UI/UX designer assistant. I want you to help me build a personal portfolio website that is extremely professional, animated, and visually stunning. I’m Fahad from Pakistan, a full-stack developer doing ICS Stats from Punjab College. This portfolio should highlight my skills, experience, and projects in an elegant and highly interactive way.

Here’s what I want the portfolio to include:

## Tech Stack for Portfolio:
- Frontend: React.js with Tailwind CSS
- Animations: Framer Motion, AOS (Animate on Scroll), or GSAP
- Backend: Not required unless needed for forms (use Email.js)
- Hosting: Vercel or GitHub Pages compatible
- Additional Tools: Lottie animations, animated SVGs, particles.js (optional)

## Pages:
1. **Home** – Animated intro with my name and role. Clean, interactive, glassmorphism or card design with hover effects.
2. **About Me** – Short background with smooth scrolling, timeline animation.
3. **Skills** – Categorized tech stack:
   - Frontend: HTML, CSS, Tailwind, JavaScript, React, TypeScript
   - Backend: Node.js, Python
   - DB: MySQL

   - Python Automation: Selenium, BeautifulSoup

4. **Projects** – Grid layout with animated cards for each project with GitHub/live links.

Generate the full project with React + Tailwind CSS, and make it visually modern, animated, and professionally designed.
